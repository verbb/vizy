# Vizy plugin for Craft CMS
<img width="500" src="https://verbb.imgix.net/plugins/vizy/vizy-social-card.png?v=3">

Vizy is a Craft CMS plugin with a visual editor field, combining everything you already know about [WYSIWYG](https://plugins.craftcms.com/redactor), the power of Matrix blocks and a sprinkle of [Neo](https://plugins.craftcms.com/neo) into an all-new editor experience.

## Features
- A fully-featured WYSIWYG field.
- All content is stored as JSON blocks. No HTML-wrangling required.
- 100% control over the output from a Vizy field.
- Create blocks inline with content. Think Matrix blocks in between your formatted text.
- Infintely nest Vizy fields for some _crazy_ business.
- Use existing fields for Vizy blocks. Even use UI elements in blocks.
- Tabs support for blocks, to keep your UI lean.
- Modularise block templates, by linking a Twig partial to blocks.
- Performance focused. No more n+1 query issues - a single database call to fetch your content.
- Query field nodes, just like you're used to with Matrix fields.
- Configure buttons and editor options with field settings or config files.
- GraphQL Support.
